## Introduction

Start with an introduction to the topic. Briefly explain the context and what the reader can expect to learn from this write-up.

## Figures (example)

Here is an example figure. The converter will automatically number figures and add captions.

Obsidian-style image (will be copied from `blog-src/assets/images/sample.png`):

![[sample.png]]

HTML-style image (example with external GitHub-hosted image):

<img width="1214" height="274" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5bc8cf6-e182-4f24-8131-5324eeaf99cd" />

You can refer to the image later in text by mentioning `sample.png` (or the external filename) and the converter will link it to the generated figure caption.

If you prefer to write HTML directly (including for local images copied by Obsidian), use the assets path the converter creates, for example:

<img src="../../assets/images/writeups/sample.png" alt="sample" />

## 1. Reconnaissance

This is where the information gathering process begins. Describe the initial steps you took to understand the target.

### Passive Reconnaissance
- Publicly available information
- WHOIS lookups
- Google dorking

### Active Reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration

Here's an example of how to format a code snippet. The copy-to-clipboard functionality is automatically handled by the site's script when the markdown is converted to HTML.

```bash
# Example of a command
nmap -sV -A -p- 127.0.0.1
```

## 2. Scanning and Enumeration

Detail the results of your scans. What ports are open? What services are running?

```plaintext
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
```

## 3. Gaining Access (Exploitation)

This is the core of the write-up. Explain the vulnerability you found and how you exploited it.

### Vulnerability Analysis
- Describe the vulnerability (e.g., SQL Injection, Path Traversal, RCE).
- Explain why it exists.

### Exploitation Steps
- Provide a step-by-step guide on how to exploit the vulnerability.
- Include code snippets and screenshots where necessary.

```python
# Example of an exploit script
import requests

url = "http://example.com/vulnerable_endpoint"
payload = {"param": "' OR 1=1 --"}

response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
print(response.text)
```

## 4. Privilege Escalation

If applicable, describe how you escalated your privileges on the system.

- **Enumeration:** What did you look for after getting initial access? (e.g., SUID binaries, cron jobs, kernel exploits)
- **Exploitation:** How did you get root/administrator access?

## 5. Post-Exploitation & Loot

What did you do after gaining full control? Did you find any flags or interesting data?

## Conclusion

Summarize the key takeaways from this write-up. What did you learn? What are the main remediation steps to prevent this kind of vulnerability?
